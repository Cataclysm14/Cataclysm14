# Roleplay Rule 8
## Certain areas are designated as Safe Zones.

Some locations, such as the Colonial Outpost (CO) and Medical Dispatch (MD), are [color=green][bold]Safe Zones[/bold][/color]: areas within a 256 meter radius of the POI center. [color=red][bold]Hostile actions[/bold][/color] (attacking, raiding, seizing control, or stealing) are [color=red][bold]never allowed[/bold][/color] in these areas, at any time.

- [color=yellow][bold]Possession of contraband is still illegal[/bold][/color] in Safe Zones. You may be searched and arrested for contraband, but not attacked or killed on sight.
- [color=yellow][bold]Having a bounty, being part of an antagonistic faction, or seeking shelter in a Safe Zone does not grant immunity from arrest or investigation.[/bold][/color] You may still be detained or arrested by authorities.
- [color=yellow][bold]Ongoing fights do not end just by entering a Safe Zone.[/bold][/color] Attempting to abuse Safe Zones to escape consequences or disrupt roleplay may result in [color=red]administrative action[/color].
- [color=yellow][bold]If an arrest or detainment escalates to violence in a Safe Zone, all parties must prioritize non-lethal outcomes.[/bold][/color] [color=red]Lethal force is strongly discouraged[/color] and may result in staff intervention.

[color=green]Safe Zones exist to provide a secure environment for roleplay, medical treatment, and new player orientation. Violating Safe Zone rules may result in administrative action.[/color]
