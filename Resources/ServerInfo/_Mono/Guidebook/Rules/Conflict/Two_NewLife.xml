# Conflict Rule 2
## Adhere to the new life rule.

- [color=red][bold]Do not return to the location of your death[/bold][/color] during an ongoing situation or to collect your previous life’s items.
- This rule applies only to [color=yellow]respawns[/color] (not to medical revivals or cloning).

[color=yellow][bold]After death, your memory and behavior depend on how you return:[/bold][/color]
- [color=green][bold]Revival (defib, medical intervention):[/bold][/color] Full memory of your previous life. You may act on all information and continue as before.
- [color=yellow][bold]Cloned (medical cloner):[/bold][/color] Forget the last 15 minutes before death (events, engagement, people involved). Do not act on information from that period.
- [color=red][bold]Respawn:[/bold][/color] Forget the last 30 minutes before death. Do not seek revenge or act on information related to your death or the last 30 minutes. You may remember earlier events, but may not return for your previous life’s items.

[italic][color=green]The New Life Rule helps maintain fairness and immersion by preventing players from immediately rejoining conflicts or recovering lost gear after death.[/color][/italic]
