# Conflict Rule 3
## Engage in fair play when making demands.

- Players must be given a reasonable time ([color=yellow][bold]at least 20 seconds[/bold][/color]) to react to demands before capture, serious injury, or death is inflicted.
- All demands must be made in [color=yellow]English[/color] so they are clearly understood by all parties.
- Use [color=green]roleplay[/color] and [color=green]escalation[/color]; avoid making impossible or unclear demands.
- [color=yellow]You are not required to hail or make demands before engaging major factions like TSFMC, USSP, or Rogues. These are combative jobs and should be aware of this risk. However, if you do make a demand, you must still give them time to respond.[/color]

[italic][color=green]Fair play ensures everyone has a chance to respond and participate in the story, rather than being caught off guard or unable to comply.[/color][/italic]
