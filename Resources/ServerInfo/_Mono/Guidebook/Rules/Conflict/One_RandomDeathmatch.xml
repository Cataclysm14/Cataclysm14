# Conflict Rule 1
## Avoid random deathmatch (RDM).

Players must have valid in-character reasons to kill or attack another player.

- [color=red][bold]Random, unprovoked attacks or killings (RDM) are not allowed.[/bold][/color]
- [color=yellow]non-lethal conflict[/color] and [color=green]roleplay escalation[/color] are strongly encouraged.
- Combat should arise naturally through roleplay, with meaningful interaction.
- [color=yellow]Non-lethal options[/color] (such as capturing, negotiating, or detaining) are strongly encouraged to foster deeper storylines.

[italic][color=green]Conflict should be meaningful, and prioritize roleplay over random violence.[/color][/italic]
