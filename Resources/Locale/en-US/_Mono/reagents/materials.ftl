reagent-name-prismaticplasma = prismatic plasma
reagent-desc-prismaticplasma = A glimmering, hypnotic near-gelatinous fluid with many reactions and utilities. You probably don't want to ingest this. Can be solidifed with nightfluid at a 5 to 0.5 unit ratio.
reagent-name-nightfluid = night fluid
reagent-desc-nightfluid = A mysterious, dark viscous sludge that can barely be called a fluid. It's been known to seep out of the anomalous monoliths in the Colossus sector. Despite its void-like darkness, you can spot specks of light within. Capable of solidifying prismatic plasma.
